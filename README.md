# XediX Version System

This is a versioning system that I've made for no literal reason.

## How to use
1. Download the source
2. Navigate to the folder in the terminal
3. Run `cd back`
4. Run `python3 start_changing.py`
  - enter the files you are changing, separated by commas
  - enter commit message
  - make changes
5. Run `python3 commit.py`
  - enter the files you changed, separated by commas
  - enter commit message
6. Try changing the branch
  - run `python3 change_branch.py`
  - enter the branch name
7. Check the changes
  - run `cd ..`
  - run `cd front`
  - open the `index.html`
